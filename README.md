# Maleficarum Storage

This component replaces the now obsolete Maleficarum Database compoment (https://github.com/pharaun13/maleficarum-database). All MSSQL code was removed and persistence layers were decoupled from actual model objects. Additionally generic Redis model/collection repository was implemented and provided as basis for project specific implementations.
